So that's one tuck, and one no tuck. The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water? Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet. I proclaim this the summer of George! That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work. So that's one tuck, and one no tuck.

I think I can sum up the show for you with one word - nothing. I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs. My whole life has been a complete waste of time. Because filth is good...Whaddaya you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lying around the bathroom? My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. My whole life has been a complete waste of time. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony? Well, the jerk-store called, and they're running out of you. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.

This was supposed to be the summer of George! You know, we're living in a society! I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. Who buys an umbrella anyway - you can get them for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans. That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work. Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by. I was in the pool! I was in the pool!

Because filth is good...Whaddaya you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lying around the bathroom? Did anybody call here asking for Vandeley Industries? I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is...guilty! I wish there were pigmen. You get a few of these pigmen walking around, I'm looking a whole lot better.

If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. Believe it or not, George isn't home, please leave a message at the beep, I must be out or I'd pick up the phone, where could I be? You know, I've been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. I was in the pool! I was in the pool!

My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.
