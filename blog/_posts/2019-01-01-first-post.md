I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham! It's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes. You know, if you take everything I've done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent. The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. The mug is round, the jar is round - they should call it Roundtine.

And the verdict is...guilty! This is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive. Lunch is fine at the beginning, then you move on to dinner. You don't move back to lunch - it's like being demoted. Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony? Well there's nothing dirtier than a big ball of oil. I hope prune juice is okay. I was in the pool! I was in the pool!

People this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I was in the pool! I was in the pool! My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. Did anybody call here asking for Vandeley Industries? I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs.

He's an importer/exporter, okay? This was supposed to be the summer of George! Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. I feel like my old self again: totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic - it's a pleasure. You know, if you take everything I've done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
