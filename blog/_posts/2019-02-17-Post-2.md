We all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch. Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. The sea was angry that day, my friends - like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. A man without hand is not a man. Did anybody call here asking for Vandeley Industries? If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. Because filth is good...Whaddaya you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lying around the bathroom? I feel like my old self again: totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic - it's a pleasure. Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by. Feel - what's that?

I hope prune juice is okay. You know, I've been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Believe it or not, George isn't home, please leave a message at the beep, I must be out or I'd pick up the phone, where could I be? This was supposed to be the summer of George!

What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water? My whole life has been a complete waste of time. This is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive. "No thank you, I don't want coffee, it keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee."
