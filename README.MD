### Vandelay Industries ###

## About ##

Vandelay Industries is a Jekyll test site, built to play around with the Jekyll framework, implement frontend features, and generally act as a hands-on learning tool.

As this is a test site, things might not be as up to date as they could be. It's really just here to help me get to grips with Jekyll.

Anyhow, please enjoy, and don't forget to always answer the phone with "Vandelay Industries"!
