    <p>I feel like my old self again: totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic - it's a pleasure. Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. I like sports. I could do something in sports. Because filth is good...Whaddaya you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lying around the bathroom? Did anybody call here asking for Vandeley Industries?</p>
    <p>You know, we're living in a society! I wish there were pigmen. You get a few of these pigmen walking around, I'm looking a whole lot better. Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. I think I can sum up the show for you with one word - nothing. Like I don't know that I'm pathetic. But I'm disturbed, I'm depressed, I'm inadequate: I've got it all!</p>
    <p>I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. Guys with cats... I don't know. You know, we're living in a society! Did anybody call here asking for Vandeley Industries? Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by. I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is...guilty!</p>
